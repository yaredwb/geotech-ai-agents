# Preliminary Geotechnical Summary Report

## 1. Project Overview
The project involves the construction of a single-story warehouse with a concrete slab-on-grade located at Industrial Zone North, Trondheim, Norway. The estimated foundation loads include approximately 500 kN for column loads and 50 kN/m for wall loads.

## 2. Site Data Summary
### Subsurface Profile
- **Layer 1 (0.0m - 2.0m depth)**:
  - **Soil Type**: Fill Material (Sand & Gravel mix)
  - **Avg N-value**: 8

- **Layer 2 (2.0m - 7.5m depth)**:
  - **Soil Type**: Medium Dense Sand
  - **Avg N-value**: 20
  - **Est. Friction Angle**: 32 degrees

- **Layer 3 (7.5m - 15.0m depth)**:
  - **Soil Type**: Stiff Clay
  - **Avg Su**: 70 kPa
  - **N-value**: > 30

### Groundwater Level
- Observed at: 3.0m depth.

## 3. Preliminary Analysis Results
- **Estimated Bearing Capacity**: 219.6 kPa
- **Estimated Bearing Pressure**: 250 kPa
- **Conclusion**: The foundation is expected to experience failure as the estimated bearing pressure exceeds the calculated bearing capacity.

### Key Assumptions
- **Foundation dimensions**: 2m x 2m at a depth of 1m.
- **Formula Used**: Terzaghiâ€™s bearing capacity equation.
- **Total Foundation Load Assumed**: 1000 kN from columns and walls.
- **Soil Properties Considered**: Fill material (N-value of 8) and estimated parameters for bearing capacity calculations.

## 4. Brief Remarks/Recommendations
Given the preliminary analysis, it is evident that the estimated bearing pressure of 250 kPa exceeds the calculated bearing capacity of 219.6 kPa, indicating a potential for foundation failure. It is recommended to consider the following actions:
- Reassess the foundation design to reduce the loading or increase the bearing capacity through soil improvement techniques such as compaction of the fill material or replacement with more competent materials.
- Conduct further detailed geotechnical investigations to gather additional site-specific data, particularly regarding the stiffness and permeability of the underlying layers.
- Evaluate alternative foundation solutions such as deeper foundations or pile systems to ensure stability and safety for the warehouse structure.
